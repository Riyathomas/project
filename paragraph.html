<h1 align="center" ><i><u>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</u></i></h1>
<p style="color:blue;">A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center"><i><u>C++</u></i></h2>
<p style="color:blue;">C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.</p>

<h2 align="center"><i><u>C</u></i></h2>
<p style="color:blue;">C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>

<h2 align="center"><i><u>Java</u></i></h2>
<p style="color:blue;">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center"><i><u>Python</u></i></h2>
<p style="color:blue;">Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.</p>
